• Attendance system to enter attendance and view students leave history.

• A timetable for each student to capture the attendance for each subject separately on their timetable of the day.

• Grade system for test and semester with arrears calculation, where staff can view the average of students in each semester in every department in search view with multiple filters. This feature will automatically carry forward the arrear subjects to next semester until cleared.

• Added to this, staff can also find students without arrear till date with top ranking across deparments.

• Staff can edit attendance, student details and their timetable under each section of a department.

• Have also introduced a system for aptitude test where all the students from department can take a test at same time in computer lab with multiple request handling.

• All the above data that are entered can be entered in the web application as well as thorugh an excel file as per each format.
